### The Distribution of Vaccines Across Countries in Europe between 2021-2023


### Description:

This repository contains static files like Index.html, styles.css and script.js which contains D3.js code for visualizing the distribution of vaccines across all the countries in Europe from 2021 to 2023 and it's trend. The data is sourced from [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases] which came in CSV format, i had to change it to json format and then convert it further to FHIR bundle (Immunization) which can be streamed by the user on the url generated from **test_fhir.py** but these data will not be saved because it is a very large dataset. Then my visualization uses a bar chart created with **D3.js** codes, with each country's flag on the tip of the bar providing an interactive and dynamic representation of the vaccination distributions across European countries and over time. i also use **GUNICORN** to export my port.

## Key User Group
**The Director of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control:** The Director of ECDC is responsible for leading the ECDC’s work in strengthening Europe’s defence against infectious disease.

## A Problem the The Director of ECDC Encouters
To specifically compare the distribution of covid-19 vaccinations of all the European countries between 2021-2023 in order TO HOWEVER; DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF VACCINES THAT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO EACH EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN JANUARY 2024.

## My Solution

This app is the solution to this problem, The Director of ECDC can use this interactive bar chart to easily understand the distribution of vaccines across different European countries within the specified period of time, she can choose any country she wants to view their statistics for the past years, she can compare 2 or more countries to not only compare there distributions over the past years, but also to check if the amount distributed to the countries matches their population and total cases there, so she can make ammendments for the next distribution in january 2024.
Due to the data i selected for this visualization, it is easier for the Director of ECDC to identify the following: 
    countries,
    date,
    total_cases,
    population,
    total_vaccinations,
    people_vaccinated,
    people_fully_vaccinated,
    total_vaccinations_per_hundred,
    people_vaccinated_per_hundred, and
    people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred for each and every European countries.

## User Objectives

Users aim to:

- To identify or rather, calculate how the next distribution would be done.
- To compare and view the statistics of each European country and make changes for the next distribution in january 2024.
- Understand the overall distribution of vaccines in Europe.
- Compare the total cases to the amount of vaccine distributed across different countries or regions.
- To compare the vaccines distributed to each European countries to their population.
- compare the distributed vaccines to the total people fully vacinated.
- To compare and view the statistics of each European country and make changes for the next distribution in january 2024.

## Visualization Strategy and how the users can achieve task with this app effectively and efficiently
